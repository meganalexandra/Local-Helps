# LocalHelps

LocalHelps is a web application built to help charitable givers connect with local non-profit organizations and charities who are willing to accept their donations. LocalHelps allows users to specify which items theyâ€™ll be donating, by choosing from a list of items ranging from non-perishable foods to feminine hygiene products. Users are then able to find a list of local organizations that accept their specific donation items.
